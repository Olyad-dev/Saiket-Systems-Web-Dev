# Apple-Clone 

Apple.com clone web app that is built using React.js and Node.js 

# Motivation

I wanted to recreate the apple.com website using node for my back end and react for my front end. 

# Description

For the back end, I used Express for my server and MySql for my database. My REST-API is serving the iphone page from the database.

For the front end, I wanted to make the current [apple.com](https://www.apple.com/) better by using a third party API from Google Cloud, specifically youTube, and incorporating it to the website, so anyone can have access to Apple's youTube channel straight from the website.
